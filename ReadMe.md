🐍 Snake Game
This is a simple Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It runs directly in your web browser — no frameworks or libraries required.

📁 Files
index.html — Defines the game layout and elements.

index.css — Contains the styling for the game grid, snake, and apple.

index.js — Handles the game logic such as snake movement, apple generation, scoring, and controls.

🎮 How to Play
Start the game:
Click the Start/Restart button to begin or restart the game.

Control the snake:
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard:

⬆️ Up Arrow → Move Up

⬇️ Down Arrow → Move Down

⬅️ Left Arrow → Move Left

➡️ Right Arrow → Move Right

Eat apples:
Guide the snake to eat the red apple squares. Each apple increases your score and lengthens the snake.

Avoid collisions:
If the snake runs into the grid boundary or into itself, the game stops.

⚙️ How It Works
The grid is a 10x10 area (100 squares total).

The snake is an array of square indices that updates on every move.

The apple appears randomly in an empty square.

The game speed increases every time the snake eats an apple.
